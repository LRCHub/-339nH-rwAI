[00:07.62] You take my breath away
[00:09.80] I know that you don't know what I'm thinking 'bout
[00:16.41] 漂うだけ 吐息の中 ah ah
[00:22.21] Come close to me
[00:26.14] And hey you, nothing's inside me 'cause already
[00:32.26] You've filled me with your love
[00:37.09] 気付かれても don't care
[00:42.77] I'm ready so
[00:44.33] Here we go, and never let me go
[00:47.76] あなたがいなくても
[00:53.11] Where we go? And never let me go
[00:56.73] Can't you feel this? Now I'm in
[01:03.20] (You wanna try it?)
[01:11.44] (Not even saw you)
[01:18.51] Imaginary love (you wanna try it?)
[01:23.30] Imaginary love
[01:27.38] Imaginary love (not even saw you)
[01:32.07] Imaginary love
[01:36.77] No reason to stay
[01:38.53] Every word you say eh もう止まれない
[01:45.19] どこにいても見つけられる 'cause I have the key to you
[01:53.52] I'm ready so
[01:55.42] Here we go, and never let me go
[01:58.87] あなたがいなくても
[02:04.24] Where we go? And never let me go
[02:08.00] Can't you feel this? Still I'm in
[02:14.60] (You wanna try it?)
[02:22.60] (Not even saw you)
[02:30.10] Imaginary love (you wanna try it?)
[02:34.11] Imaginary love
[02:38.30] Imaginary love (not even saw you)
[02:43.11] Imaginary love
[02:48.98] Inside your love, inside your bones
[02:53.61] 流れ着くのは全てが your mind
[02:58.02] Inside your love, inside your bones
[03:00.78] I knew it all along
[03:03.16] I knew it all along-long-long-long
[03:08.49] Imaginary love, love, love (you wanna try it?)
[03:12.99] Imaginary love
[03:17.18] Imaginary love (not even saw you)
[03:21.34] Imaginary love
[03:26.69] (Imaginary love)
[03:28.22] Inside your love, inside your bones (you wanna try it?)
[03:32.08] 流れ着くのは全てが your mind
[03:36.55] Inside your love, inside your bones (imaginary love)
[03:39.74] I knew it all along
[03:41.66] I knew it all along

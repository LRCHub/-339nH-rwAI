How Can I explain this
Why won't you feel
Isn't it an obvious thing
To nurture and to give
Why won't you reach out
Open your heart to me
I know you have a heart that loves
Why can't it be?

You know I tried so hard to love you
I tried so hard to believe
Thought if I could love for the two of us
You'll wake up one day to see
This imaginary love

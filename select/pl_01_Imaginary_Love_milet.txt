You take my breath away
I know that you don't know
what I'm thinking 'bout
漂うだけ 吐息の中
Come close to me
And hey you, nothing's inside me
'cause already you've filled me with your love
気付かれても don't care
I'm ready so
Here we go, and never let me go
あなたがいなくても
Where we go? And never let me go
Can't you feel this? Now I'm in
Imaginary love...
No reason to stay
Every word you say もう止まれない
どこにいても見つけられる
'cause I have the key to you
I'm ready so
Here we go, and never let me go
あなたがいなくても
Where we go? And never let me go
Can't you feel this? Still I'm in
Imaginary love...
Inside your love, inside your bones
流れ着くのは全てが your mind
Inside your love, inside your bones
I knew it all along
I knew it all along
Imaginary love...
